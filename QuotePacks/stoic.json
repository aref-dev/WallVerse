    "What decides whether a sum of money is good? The money is not going to\ntell you; it must be the faculty that makes use of such impressions \u2013\nreason.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Being attached to many things, we are weighed down and dragged along\nwith them.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "What should we do then? Make the best use of what is in our power, and\ntreat the rest in accordance with its nature.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "What should we have ready at hand in a situation like this? The\nknowledge of what is mine and what is not mine, what I can and cannot\ndo.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "\"I will throw you into prison.\" \"Correction \u2013 it is my body you will\nthrow there.\"\n\t--Epictetus",
    "I have to die. If it is now, well then I die now; if later, then now I\nwill take my lunch, since the hour for lunch has arrived \u2013 and dying I\nwill tend to later.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Consider at what price you sell your integrity; but please, for God's\nsake, don't sell it cheap.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "What is the goal of virtue, after all, except a life that flows\nsmoothly?\n\t--Epictetus",
    "If from the moment they get up in the morning they adhere to their\nideals, eating and bathing like a person of integrity, putting their\nprinciples into practice in every situation they face \u2013 the way a\nrunner does when he applies the principles of running, or a singer\nthose of musicianship \u2013 that is where you will see true progress\nembodied, and find someone who has not wasted their time making the\njourney here from home.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "What else are tragedies but the ordeals of people who have come to\nvalue externals, tricked out in tragic verse?\n\t--Epictetus",
    "If a man objects to truths that are all too evident, it is no easy task\nfinding arguments that will change his mind. This is proof neither of\nhis own strength nor of his teacher's weakness. When someone caught in\nan argument hardens to stone, there is just no more reasoning with\nthem.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Most of us dread the deadening of the body and will do anything to\navoid it. About the deadening of the soul, however, we don't care one\niota.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "And so it is inexcusable for man to begin and end where the beasts do.\nHe should begin where they do, but only end where nature left off\ndealing with him; which is to say, in contemplation and understanding.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "\"But my nose is running!\" What do you have hands for, idiot, if not to\nwipe it? \"But how is it right that there be running noses in the first\nplace?\" Instead of thinking up protests, wouldn't it be easier just to\nwipe your nose?\n\t--Epictetus",
    "For what does reason purport to do? \"Establish what is true, eliminate\nwhat is false and suspend judgement in doubtful cases.\" ... What else\ndoes reason prescribe? \"To accept the consequence of what has been\nadmitted to be correct.\"\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Why are we still lazy, indifferent and dull? Why do we look for excuses\nto avoid training and exercising our powers of reason? \"Look, if I err\nin such matters I haven't killed my father, have I?\" No, fool \u2013 for\nthere was no father there for you to kill! What did you do instead? You\nmade the only mistake you had the opportunity to make.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Don't confuse qualities that are found in the same writer only\nincidentally. If Plato had been strong and handsome, should I also try\nto become strong and handsome, as if this were essential to philosophy,\nsince there was one particular philosopher who combined philosophy with\ngood looks?\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Ask me what the real good in man's case is, and I can only say that it\nis the right kind of moral character.\n\t--Epictetus",

    "It isn't death, pain, exile or anything else you care to mention that\naccounts for the way we act, only our opinion about death, pain and the\nrest.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "We, not externals, are the masters of our judgements.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Socrates was not in prison, because he chose to be there.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "You ought to realize, you take up very little space in the world as a\nwhole \u2013 your body, that is; in reason, however, you yield to no one,\nnot even to the gods, because reason is not measured in size but sense.\nSo why not care for that side of you, where you and the gods are\nequals?\n\t--Epictetus",
    "If you have been placed in a position above others, are you\nautomatically going to behave like a despot? Remember who you are and\nwhom you govern \u2013 that they are kinsmen, brothers by nature, fellow\ndescendants of Zeus.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "You can process in your intellect and senses a wealth of thoughts and\nimpressions simultaneously. There are impressions that you assent to,\nothers that you reject; sometimes you suspend judgement altogether.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Nothing important comes into being overnight; even grapes or figs need\ntime to ripen. If you say that you want a fig now, I will tell you to\nbe patient. First, you must allow the tree to flower, then put forth\nfruit; then you have to wait until the fruit is ripe. So if the fruit\nof a fig tree is not brought to maturity instantly or in an hour, how\ndo you expect the human mind to come to fruition, so quickly and\neasily?\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Since reason is what analyses and coordinates everything, it should not\ngo itself unanalysed. Then what will it be analysed by? Obviously by\nitself or something different. Now, this something different must\neither be reason or something superior to reason \u2013 which is impossible,\nsince there is nothing superior to reason.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Which, I suppose, is why Stoics put logic at the head of our curriculum\n\u2013 for the same reason that, before a quantity of grain can be measured,\nwe must settle on a standard of measurement.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "\"What about if someone threatens me with death, though; surely he\ncompels me then?\" It isn't what you're threatened with \u2013 it's the fact\nthat you prefer to do anything rather than die. It's your set of values\nthat compelled you: will acting on will.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "We use labels like \"thief\" and \"robber\" in connection with them, but\nwhat do these words mean? They merely signify that people are confused\nabout what is good and what is bad. So should we be angry with them, or\nshould we pity them instead?\n\t--Epictetus",
    "\"But the tyrant will chain \u2013\" What will he chain? Your leg. \"He will\nchop off \u2013\" What? Your head. What he will never chain or chop off is\nyour integrity.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "We should discipline ourselves in small things, and from there progress\nto things of greater value. If you have a headache, practise not\ncursing. Don't curse every time you have an earache. And I'm not saying\nthat you can't complain, only don't complain with your whole being.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "\"But I get to wear a crown of gold.\" If you have your heart set on\nwearing crowns, why not make one out of roses \u2013 you will look even more\nelegant in that.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "If you want to know just how little concerned you are about things good\nand bad, and how serious about things indifferent, compare your\nattitude to going blind with your attitude about being mentally in the\ndark. You will realize, I think, how inappropriate your values really\nare.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "When someone is properly grounded in life, they shouldn't have to look\noutside themselves for approval.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Who exactly are these people that you want to be admired by? Aren't\nthey the same people you are in the habit of calling crazy? And is this\nyour life ambition, then \u2013 to win the approval of lunatics?\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Jews, Syrians, Egyptians and Romans. They don't dispute that what is\nholy should be preferred above everything else and in every case\npursued; but they argue, for example, over whether it is holy or unholy\nto eat pork.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "The operations of the will are in our power; not in our power are the\nbody, the body's parts, property, parents, siblings, children, country\nor friends.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "The true man is revealed in difficult times. So when trouble comes,\nthink of yourself as a wrestler whom God, like a trainer, has paired\nwith a tough young buck. For what purpose? To turn you into Olympic-\nclass material. But this is going to take some sweat to accomplish.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Death, [Diogenes] said, was not evil because it was not dishonourable.\nReputation was the empty noise of fools.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Don't believe your situation is genuinely bad \u2013 no one can make you do\nthat. Is there smoke in the house? If it's not suffocating, I will stay\nindoors; if it proves too much, I'll leave. Always remember \u2013 the door\nis open.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Remember that it is we who torment, we who make difficulties for\nourselves \u2013 that is, our opinions do. What, for instance, does it mean\nto be insulted? Stand by a rock and insult it, and what have you\naccomplished? If someone responds to insult like a rock, what has the\nabuser gained with his invective?\n\t--Epictetus",
    "This, then, is the beginning of philosophy \u2013 an awareness of one's own\nmental fitness.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Death is necessary and cannot be avoided. I mean, where am I going to\ngo to get away from it?\n\t--Epictetus",
    "I cannot escape death, but at least I can escape the fear of it.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Passions stem from frustrated desire.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "You Sceptics, who dismiss the evidence of the senses \u2013 do you act any\ndifferently? Which one of you ever went to the mill when you were in\nneed of a bath?\n\t--Epictetus",
    "When someone assents to a false proposition, be sure that they did not\nwant to give their assent, since, as Plato says, \"Every soul is\ndeprived of the truth against its will.\" They simply mistook for true\nsomething false.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "The essence of good and evil consists in the condition of our\ncharacter. And externals are the means by which our character finds its\nparticular good and evil.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Correct judgements about externals make our character good, as perverse\nor distorted ones make it bad.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "This is how I came to lose my lamp: the thief was better than I am in\nstaying awake. But he acquired the lamp at a price: he became a thief\nfor its sake, for its sake, he lost his ability to be trusted, for a\nlamp he became a brute. And he imagined he came out ahead!\n\t--Epictetus",
    "If you didn't learn these things in order to demonstrate them in\npractice, what did you learn them for?\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Anyone who affirms that, in a circle, lines that extend from the centre\nto the circumference can be unequal is not going to win the respect of\nmathematicians. So \u2013 a true philosopher is under no obligation to\nrespect vulgar opinion as to what is religious or irreligious, what is\njust or unjust.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "\"Define for me now what the \"indifferents\" are.\" \"Whatever things we\ncannot control.'\"Tell me the upshot.\" \"They are nothing to me.\"\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Death and pain are not frightening, it's the fear of pain and death we\nneed to fear. Which is why we praise the poet who wrote, \"Death is not\nfearful, but dying like a coward is.\"\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Pain too is just a scary mask: look under it and you will see. The body\nsometimes suffers, but relief is never far behind. And if that isn't\ngood enough for you, the door stands open; otherwise put up with it.\nThe door needs to stay open whatever the circumstances, with the result\nthat our problems disappear.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "The masses are wrong to say that only freeborn men are entitled to an\neducation; believe the philosophers instead, who say that only educated\npeople are entitled to be called free.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "If you want to be a man of honour and a man of your word, who is going\nto stop you? You say you don't want to be obstructed or forced to do\nsomething against your will \u2013 well, who is going to force you to desire\nthings that you don't approve, or dislike something against your better\njudgement?\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Whenever externals are more important to you than your own integrity,\nthen be prepared to serve them the remainder of your life.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "We know how to analyse arguments, and have the skill a person needs to\nevaluate competent logicians. But in life what do I do? What today I\nsay is good tomorrow I will swear is bad. And the reason is that,\ncompared to what I know about syllogisms, my knowledge and experience\nof life fall far behind.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "What are we really doing when we throw away our innate faithfulness, to\nintrigue with our neighbour's wife? We are ruining and destroying \u2013\nwell, what? How about the man of trust, principle and piety that once\nwas? And is that all? Aren't we also ruining the idea of\nneighbourliness, friendship and community? What position are we putting\nourselves in? How am I supposed to deal with you now? As a neighbour? A\nfriend? Some friend! A fellow citizen? But how can a fellow citizen\nlike you be trusted?\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Material things per se are indifferent, but the use we make of them is\nnot indifferent.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Getting those things is not in my control \u2013 and not good or bad in any\ncase. But the way I use them is good or bad, and depends on me.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "It's something like going on an ocean voyage. What can I do? Pick the\ncaptain, the boat, the date, and the best time to sail. But then a\nstorm hits. Well, it's no longer my business; I have done everything I\ncould. It's somebody else's problem now \u2013 namely the captain's. But\nthen the boat actually begins to sink. What are my options? I do the\nonly thing I am in a position to do, drown \u2013 but fearlessly, without\nbawling or crying out to God, because I know that what is born must\nalso die.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "To be sure, external things of whatever kind require skill in their\nuse, but we must not grow attached to them; whatever they are, they\nshould only serve for us to show how skilled we are in our handling of\nthem.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "What are you? A human being. If you think of yourself as a unit apart,\nthen it is in accordance with your nature to live to old age, to be\nrich, and be healthy. But if your view of yourself involves being part\nof a whole, then, for the sake of the whole, circumstances may make it\nright for you to be sick, go on a dangerous journey, endure poverty,\neven die before your time.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Because what is a human being? Part of a community \u2013 the community of\ngods and men, primarily, and secondarily that of the city we happen to\ninhabit, which is only a microcosm of the universe in toto.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "So when you hear that even life and the like are indifferent, don't\nbecome apathetic; and by the same token, when you're advised to care\nabout them, don't become superficial and conceive a passion for\nexternals.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Because we're the only animals who not only die but are conscious of it\neven while it happens, we are beset by anxiety.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "\"My God, what if I'm sent to Gyara?\" Well, if that's tolerable for you,\nyou will go; if not, you have the choice of another destination, the\nplace even the person who sent you to Gyara is headed, whether they\nlike it or not.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "You think I can listen to poetry in my position?\" \"Why, what is it?\"\n\"I'm sentenced to death!\" \"And the rest of us aren't?\"\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Since plants do not even have the power of perception, \"good\" and\n\"evil\" are not applicable to them. Evidently, \"good\" and \"bad\" presume\nthe power of using impressions.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "A will that never fails to get what it wants, a faculty of aversion\nthat always avoids what it dislikes, proper impulse, careful purpose\nand disciplined assent. That's the human specimen you should prepare\nyourselves to see.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Never get into family fights over material things; give them up\nwillingly, and your moral standing will increase in proportion.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Reflect on the other social roles you play. If you are a council\nmember, consider what a council member should do. If you are young,\nwhat does being young mean, if you are old, what does age imply, if you\nare a father, what does fatherhood entail? Each of our titles, when\nreflected upon, suggests the acts appropriate to it.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "If you lost the capacity to read, or play music, you would think it was\na disaster, but you think nothing of losing the capacity to be honest,\ndecent and civilized.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "If money is your only standard, then consider that, by your lights,\nsomeone who loses their nose does not suffer any harm.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "If \"good\" as well as \"bad\" really relate to our choices, then consider\nwhether your position does not amount to saying something like, \"Well,\nsince that guy hurt himself with the injustice he did me, shouldn't I\nwrong him in order to hurt myself in retaliation?\"\n\t--Epictetus",
    "\"Well, whatever you may say, I know good from bad, and have an idea of\nthe good.\" You have one, I allow. \"And I put it into practice.\" You use\nit in specific instances, yes. \"And I use it correctly.\" Well, that's\nthe crux, because this is where opinions become an issue.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Here you have philosophy's starting point: we find that people cannot\nagree among themselves, and we go in search of the source of their\ndisagreement.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Something good should be a source of pride, correct? \"Yes.\" And can one\nreally take pride in a momentary pleasure? Please don't say yes.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "When a guide meets up with someone who is lost, ordinarily his reaction\nis to direct him on the right path, not mock or malign him, then turn\non his heel and walk away. As for you, lead someone to the truth and\nyou will find that he can follow. But as long as you don't point it out\nto him, don't make fun of him; be aware of what you need to work on\ninstead.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "That is what Socrates would do: he would quit only after he had fleshed\nout an idea and explored its implications. He wouldn't just say,\n\"Define envy for me,\" then, when his discourses interlocutor had\nventured on a definition, say, \"Wrong: your definiens is not\nextensionally equivalent to the definiendum.\"\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Now that is the first thing Socrates was known for \u2013 never turning\ndialogue into dispute, never introducing rudeness or invective,\nalthough he would put up with the insults of others in order to avoid a\nfight.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "At this point you run the risk of him saying, \"What business is that of\nyours, sir? What are you to me?\" Pester him further, and he is liable\nto punch you in the nose. I myself was once keen for this sort of\ndiscourse, until I met with just such a reception.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Take a lyre player: he's relaxed when he performs alone, but put him in\nfront of an audience, and it's a different story, no matter how\nbeautiful his voice or how well he plays the instrument. Why? Because\nhe not only wants to perform well, he wants to be well received \u2013 and\nthe latter lies outside his control.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "It was Antigonus who was anxious before their meeting. Naturally \u2013 he\nwanted to make a good impression, which was beyond his control. Zeno,\nfor his part, had no wish to please the king; no expert needs\nvalidation from an amateur.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Becoming a carpenter or pilot, we realize, requires some formal\ntraining. Is it unreasonable to suppose that it will take more than\njust the desire to be good or bad \u2013 that the student of philosophy will\nalso have to learn a few things of his own?\n\t--Epictetus",
    "And yet I won't have done you any harm \u2013 any more than a mirror is to\nblame when it shows a plain person what they look like; or a doctor is\nmean if he tells a patient, \"Look, you may think this is insignificant,\nbut you're really sick; no food for you today, only water.\" No one\nthinks, \"How rude!\" But say to someone, \"Your desires are unhealthy,\nyour powers of aversion are weak, your plans are incoherent, your\nimpulses are at odds with nature and your system of values is false and\nconfused,\" \u2013 and off they go alleging slander.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "\"But we must stick with a decision.\" \"For heaven's sake, man, that rule\nonly applies to sound decisions. I suppose next you will decide that it\nis night now, and refuse to change your mind because you don't want to.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "\"A fool cannot be convinced or even compelled to renounce his folly.\"\nGod save me from fools with a little philosophy \u2013 no one is more\ndifficult to reach.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Where does the good lie? \"In the will.\" And evil? \"Also in the will.\"\nAnd things neither good nor bad \u2013 \"... lie in whatever is external to\nthe will.\"\n\t--Epictetus",
    "You might as well get on your knees and pray that your nose won't run.\nA better idea would be to wipe your nose and forgo the prayer. The\npoint is, isn't there anything God gave you for your present problem?\nYou have the gifts of courage, fortitude and endurance. With \"hands\"\nlike these, do you still need somebody to help wipe your nose?\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Show me one person who cares how they act, someone for whom success is\nless important than the manner in which it is achieved. While out\nwalking, who gives any thought to the act of walking itself? Who pays\nattention to the process of planning, not just the outcome?\n\t--Epictetus",
    "The first thing a pretender to philosophy must do is get rid of their\npresuppositions; a person is not going to undertake to learn anything\nthat they think they already know.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "This presumption that you possess knowledge of any use has to be\ndropped before you approach philosophy \u2013 just as if we were enrolling\nin a school of music or mathematics.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "If you like doing something, do it regularly; if you don't like doing\nsomething, make a habit of doing something different. The same goes for\nmoral inclinations. When you get angry, you should know that you aren't\nguilty of an isolated lapse, you've encouraged a trend and thrown fuel\non the fire.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "If you don't want to be cantankerous, don't feed your temper, or\nmultiply incidents of anger. Suppress the first impulse to be angry,\nthen begin to count the days on which you don't get mad.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "It will even do to socialize with men of good character, in order to\nmodel your life on theirs, whether you choose someone living or someone\nfrom the past.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Don't let the force of the impression when first it hits you knock you\noff your feet; just say to it, \"Hold on a moment; let me see who you\nare and what you represent. Let me put you to the test.\"\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Today people care only for academic discussion, nothing beyond that.\nBut I'm presenting to you the real athlete, namely the one training to\nface off against the most formidable of impressions.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Show me someone untroubled with disturbing thoughts about illness,\ndanger, death, exile or loss of reputation. By all the gods, I want to\nsee a Stoic!\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Even people who deny that statements can be valid or impressions clear\nare obliged to make use of both. You might almost say that nothing\nproves the validity of a statement more than finding someone forced to\nuse it while at the same time denying that it is sound.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "A vine cannot behave olively, nor an olive tree vinely \u2013 it is\nimpossible, inconceivable. No more can a human being wholly efface his\nnative disposition.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "What illusion about myself do I entertain?\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Don't be disappointed if you return home with the very same set of\nideas you arrived with. Because you had no intention of changing,\ncorrecting or adopting others in their place.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "You say the speculative topics are useless. Useless to whom? Only to\npeople who don't use them as they should. I mean, salves and ointments\nare not useless to people who apply them when and how they're supposed\nto; weights are not useless in themselves, they're useful to some\npeople, worthless to others.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "If someone is incapable of distinguishing good things from bad and\nneutral things from either \u2013 well, how could such a person be capable\nof love? The power to love, then, belongs only to the wise man.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "You're subject to sorrow, fear, jealousy, anger and inconsistency.\nThat's the real reason you should admit that you are not wise.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "No doubt you have seen dogs playing with, and fawning before, each\nother, and thought, \"Nothing could be friendlier.\" But just throw some\nmeat in the middle, and then you'll know what friendship amounts to.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Paris was Menelaus\" guest, and anyone who saw how well they treated\neach other would have laughed at anyone who said they weren't friends.\nBut between the two a bit of temptation was thrown in the form of a\nbeautiful woman, and over that there arose war.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Just ask whether they put their self-interest in externals or in moral\nchoice. If it's in externals, you cannot call them friends, any more\nthan you can call them trustworthy, consistent, courageous or free.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "For where else is friendship found if not with fairness, reliability\nand respect for virtue only?\n\t--Epictetus",
    "[Treat] unenlightened souls with sympathy and indulgence, remembering\nthat they are ignorant or mistaken about what's most important. Never\nbe harsh, remember Plato's dictum: \"Every soul is deprived of the truth\nagainst its will.\"\n\t--Epictetus",
    "An eye, when open, has no option but to see. The decision whether to\nlook at a particular man's wife, however, and how, belongs to the will.\nAnd the determination whether to trust what someone says, and then, if\nwe trust them, whether we should be angered by it \u2013 that also belongs\nto the will.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "People act like a traveller headed for home who stops at an inn and,\nfinding it comfortable, decides to remain there. You've lost sight of\nyour goal, man. You were supposed to drive through the inn, not park\nthere.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Some students [of philosophy] become captivated by all these things and\ndon't want to proceed further. One is captivated by diction, another by\ndeductive or equivocal arguments, someone else by yet another \"inn\" of\nthis kind; and there they stay and rot as if seduced by the Sirens.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "When I see that one thing [virtue] is supreme and most important, I\ncannot say that something else is, just to make you happy.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "The body is the raw material of the doctor and physical therapist. Land\nis the farmer's raw material. The raw material of the good man is his\nmind \u2013 his goal being to respond to impressions the way nature\nintended.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "What, after all, are sighing and crying, except opinions? What is\n\"misfortune'? An opinion. And sectarian strife, dissension, blame and\naccusation, ranting and raving \u2013 they all are mere opinion, the opinion\nthat good and bad lie outside us.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Speaking for myself, I hope death overtakes me when I'm occupied solely\nwith the care of my character, in an effort to make it passionless,\nfree, unrestricted and unrestrained.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "What does Socrates say? \"One person likes tending to his farm, another\nto his horse; I like to daily monitor my self-improvement.\"\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Keep well out of the sun, then, so long as your principles are as\npliant as wax.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "\"Being healthy is good, being sick is bad.\" No, my friend: enjoying\nhealth in the right way is good; making bad use of your health is bad.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "For God's sake, stop honouring externals, quit turning yourself into\nthe tool of mere matter, or of people who can supply you or deny you\nthose material things.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "A boxer derives the greatest advantage from his sparring partner \u2013 and\nmy accuser is my sparring partner. He trains me in patience, civility\nand even temper.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "I have a bad neighbour \u2013 bad, that is, for himself. For me, though, he\nis good: he exercises my powers of fairness and sociability.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "My mind represents for me my medium \u2013 like wood to a carpenter, or\nleather to a shoemaker. The goal in my case is the correct use of\nimpressions.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Look, can you be forced to assent to what appears to you wrong?\" \"No.\"\n\"Or to dissent from the plain truth?\" \"No.\" \"Then you see you do have\nwithin you a share of freedom.\"\n\t--Epictetus",
    "All our efforts must be directed towards an end, or we will act in\nvain. If it is not the right end, we will fail utterly.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Do you want to know if you are educated? Show us your values,\nphilosopher.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "He's a clever young man and a fan of rhetoric.\" \"How do you know?\" \"He\npraises me.\" Oh, well, that proves it, of course.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Understand what words you use first, then use them.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Friends, the school of a philosopher is a hospital. When you leave, you\nshould have suffered, not enjoyed yourself.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Who wants to live with delusion and prejudice, being unjust,\nundisciplined, mean and ungrateful? \"No one.\" No bad person, then,\nlives the way he wants, and no bad man is free.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "So you admit that you have at least one master. And don't let the fact\nthat Caesar rules over everyone, as you say, console you: it only means\nthat you're a slave in a very large household.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "\"Do we have that many masters?\" We do. Because over and above the rest\nwe have masters in the form of circumstances, which are legion. And\nanyone who controls any one of them controls us as well.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "What makes for freedom and fluency in the practice of writing?\nKnowledge of how to write. The same goes for the practice of playing an\ninstrument. It follows that, in the conduct of life, there must be a\nscience to living well.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "But suppose I choose to walk, and someone obstructs me?\" What part of\nyou will they obstruct? Certainly not your power of assent? \"No, my\nbody.\" Your body, yes \u2013 as they might obstruct a rock. \"Perhaps; but\nthe upshot is, now I'm not allowed to walk.\" Whoever told you, \"Walking\nis your irrevocable privilege'? I said only that the will to walk could\nnot be obstructed.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "A plant or animal fares poorly when it acts contrary to its nature; and\na human being is no different. Well, then, biting, kicking, wanton\nimprisonment and beheading \u2013 is that what our nature entails? No;\nrather, acts of kindness, cooperation and good will. And so, whether\nyou like it or not, a person fares poorly whenever he acts like an\ninsensitive brute.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "People to whom such things are still denied come to imagine that\neverything good will be theirs if only they could acquire them. Then\nthey get them: and their longing is unchanged, their anxiety is\nunchanged, their disgust is no less, and they still long for whatever\nis lacking. Freedom is not achieved by satisfying desire, but by\neliminating it.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Formerly, when you were devoted to worthless pursuits, your friends\nfound you congenial company. But you can't be a hit in both roles. To\nthe extent you cultivate one you will fall short in the other.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "If you forfeit an external possession, make sure to notice what you get\nin return. If it is something more valuable, never say, \"I have\nsuffered a loss.\"\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Very little is needed for everything to be upset and ruined, only a\nslight lapse in reason. It's much easier for a mariner to wreck his\nship than it is for him to keep it sailing safely; all he has to do is\nhead a little more upwind and disaster is instantaneous. In fact, he\ndoes not have to do anything: a momentary loss of attention will\nproduce the same result.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "The more we value things outside our control, the less control we have.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Either you're going to be depressed when your wish is not realized or\nfoolishly pleased with yourself if it is, overjoyed for the wrong\nreasons.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Just prove to me that you are trustworthy, high-minded and reliable,\nand that your intentions are benign \u2013 prove to me that your jar doesn't\nhave a hole in it \u2013 and you'll find that I won't even wait for you to\nopen your heart to me, I'll be the first to implore you to lend an ear\nto my own affairs.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "If we try to adapt our mind to the regular sequence of changes and\naccept the inevitable with good grace, our life will proceed quite\nsmoothly and harmoniously.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Impressions (which philosophers call), striking a person's mind as soon\nas he perceives something within range of his senses, are not voluntary\nor subject to his will, they impose themselves on people's attention\nalmost with a will of their own. But the act of assent (which they\ncall) which endorses these impressions is voluntary and a function of\nthe human will.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Most apparent philosophers were philosophers not in their actions, only\ntheir words.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "There were two vices much blacker and more serious than the rest: lack\nof persistence and lack of self-control ... persist and resist.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "I say that virtue is more valuable than wealth to the same degree that\neyes are more valuable than fingernails.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "I blush deeply whenever I catch myself saying anything disgraceful.\nIt's this reflex that will not allow me to propose pleasure as the good\nand the goal of life.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "It is just charming how people boast about qualities beyond their\ncontrol. For instance, \"I am better than you because I have many\nestates, while you are practically starving'; or, \"I'm a consul,\" \"I'm\na governor,\" or \"I have fine curly hair.\"\n\t--Epictetus",
    "People who are physically ill are unhappy with a doctor who doesn't\ngive them advice, because they think he has given up on them. Shouldn't\nwe feel the same towards a philosopher \u2013 and assume that he has given\nup hope of our ever becoming rational \u2013 if he will no longer tell us\nwhat we need (but may not like) to hear?\n\t--Epictetus",
    "People with a strong physical constitution can tolerate extremes of hot\nand cold; people of strong mental health can handle anger, grief, joy\nand the other emotions.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Once, when [Agrippinus] was preparing for lunch, a messenger arrived\nfrom Rome announcing that Nero had sentenced him to exile. Unflustered\nhe replied, \"Then why don't we just move our lunch to Aricia.\"\n\t--Epictetus",
    "So does this misfortune prevent you in any way from being just,\ngenerous, sober, reasonable, careful, free from error, courteous, free,\netc. \u2013 all of which together make human nature complete?\n\t--Epictetus",
    "We are responsible for some things, while there are others for which we\ncannot be held responsible.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "If you have the right idea about what really belongs to you and what\ndoes not, you will never be subject to force or hindrance, you will\nnever blame or criticize anyone, and everything you do will be done\nwillingly.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "So make a practice at once of saying to every strong impression: \"An\nimpression is all you are, not the source of the impression.\" Then test\nand assess it with your criteria, but one primarily: ask, \"Is this\nsomething that is, or is not, in my control?\"\n\t--Epictetus",
    "The faculty of desire purports to aim at securing what you want, while\naversion purports to shield you from what you don't. If you fail in\nyour desire, you are unfortunate, if you experience what you would\nrather avoid you are unhappy.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "It is not events that disturb people, it is their judgements concerning\nthem.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "An ignorant person is inclined to blame others for his own misfortune.\nTo blame oneself is proof of progress. But the wise man never has to\nblame another or himself.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "What quality belongs to you? The intelligent use of impressions. If you\nuse impressions as nature enchiridion prescribes, go ahead and indulge\nyour pride, because then you will be celebrating a quality distinctly\nyour own.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Don't hope that events will turn out the way you want, welcome events\nin whichever way they happen: this is the path to peace.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Provoked by the sight of a handsome man or a beautiful woman, you will\ndiscover within you the contrary power of self-restraint. Faced with\npain, you will discover the power of endurance. If you are insulted,\nyou will discover patience. In time, you will grow to be confident that\nthere is not a single impression that you will not have the moral means\nto tolerate.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Under no circumstances ever say \"I have lost something,\" only \"I\nreturned it.\"\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Starting with things of little value \u2013 a bit of spilled oil, a little\nstolen wine \u2013 repeat to yourself: \"For such a small price I buy\ntranquillity and peace of mind.\"\n\t--Epictetus",
    "You have to realize, it isn't easy to keep your will in agreement with\nnature, as well as externals. Caring about the one inevitably means you\nare going to shortchange the other.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Remember to act always as if you were at a symposium. When the food or\ndrink comes around, reach out and take some politely; if it passes you\nby don't try pulling it back. And if it has not reached you yet, don't\nlet your desire run ahead of you, be patient until your turn comes.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Don't let outward appearances mislead you into thinking that someone\nwith more prestige, power or some other distinction must on that\naccount be happy.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Remember, it is not enough to be hit or insulted to be harmed, you must\nbelieve that you are being harmed. If someone succeeds in provoking\nyou, realize that your mind is complicit in the provocation. ... Take a\nmoment before reacting, and you will find it is easier to maintain\ncontrol.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "If you commit to philosophy, be prepared at once to be laughed at and\nmade the butt of many snide remarks.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "If I can make money while remaining honest, trustworthy and dignified,\nshow me how and I will do it. But if you expect me to sacrifice my own\nvalues, just so you can get your hands on things that aren't even good\n\u2013 well, you can see yourself how thoughtless and unfair you're being.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "\"Well, what will my profession in the community be?\" Whatever position\nyou are equipped to fill, so long as you preserve the man of trust and\nintegrity.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "When somebody's wife or child dies, to a man we all routinely say,\n\"Well, that's part of life.\" But if one of our own family is involved,\nthen right away it's \"Poor, poor me!\" We would do better to remember\nhow we react when a similar loss afflicts others.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "If your body was turned over to just anyone, you would doubtless take\nexception. Why aren't you ashamed that you have made your mind\nvulnerable to anyone who happens to criticize you, so that it\nautomatically becomes confused and upset?\n\t--Epictetus",
    "\"My brother is unfair to me.\" Well then, keep up your side of the\nrelationship; don't concern yourself with his behaviour, only with what\nyou must do to keep your will in tune with nature. Another person will\nnot hurt you without your cooperation; you are hurt the moment you\nbelieve yourself to be.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Settle on the type of person you want to be and stick to it, whether\nalone or in company.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "When you're called upon to speak, then speak, but never about\nbanalities like gladiators, horses, sports, food and drink \u2013 common-\nplace stuff. Above all don't gossip about people, praising, blaming or\ncomparing them.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "If you learn that someone is speaking ill of you, don't try to defend\nyourself against the rumours; respond instead with, \"Yes, and he\ndoesn't know the half of it, because he could have said more.\"\n\t--Epictetus",
    "In your conversation, don't dwell at excessive length on your own deeds\nor adventures. Just because you enjoy recounting your exploits doesn't\nmean that others derive the same pleasure from hearing about them.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Take a minute and let the matter wait on you. Then reflect on both\nintervals of time: the time you will have to experience the pleasure,\nand the time after its enjoyment that you will beat yourself up over\nit.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "As you are careful when you walk not to step on a nail or turn your\nankle, so you should take care not to do any injury to your character\nat the same time.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Whenever anyone criticizes or wrongs you, remember that they are only\ndoing or saying what they think is right. They cannot be guided by your\nviews, only their own; so if their views are wrong, they are the ones\nwho suffer insofar as they are misguided. I mean, if someone declares a\ntrue conjunctive proposition to be false, the proposition is\nunaffected, it is they who come off worse for having their ignorance\nexposed.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "[When someone does something you don't like] Say to yourself each time,\n\"He did what he believed was right.\"\n\t--Epictetus",
    "If your brother mistreats you, don't try to come to grips with it by\ndwelling on the wrong he's done (because that approach makes it\nunbearable); remind yourself that he's your brother, that you two grew\nup together; then you'll find that you can bear it.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "The following are non-sequiturs: \"I am richer, therefore superior to\nyou'; or \"I am a better speaker, therefore a better person, than you.\"\n\t--Epictetus",
    "Someone bathes in haste; don't say he bathes badly, but in haste.\nSomeone drinks a lot of wine; don't say he drinks badly, but a lot.\nUntil you know their reasons, how do you know that their actions are\nvicious?\n\t--Epictetus",
    "The mark and attitude of the ordinary man: never look for help or harm\nfrom yourself, only from outsiders. The mark and attitude of the\nphilosopher: look for help and harm exclusively from yourself.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "If I admire the interpretation [of a philosophical treatise], I have\nturned into a literary critic instead of a philosopher, the only\ndifference being that, instead of Homer, I'm interpreting Chrysippus.\n\t--Epictetus",
    "How long will you wait before you demand the best of yourself, and\ntrust reason to determine what is best?\n\t--Epictetus",
    "When faced with anything painful or pleasurable, anything bringing\nglory or disrepute, realize that the crisis is now, that the Olympics\nhave started, and waiting is no longer an option; that the chance for\nprogress, to keep or lose, turns on the events of a single day.\n\t--Epictetus",

    "From Alexander the Platonic [I learned not] continually to excuse the\nneglect of duties required by our relations to those with whom we live,\nby alleging urgent occupations.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "From Catulus [I learned] not to be indifferent when a friend finds\nfault, even if he should find fault without reason, but to try to\nrestore him to his usual disposition.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "From my brother Severus [I learned] to love my kin, and to love truth,\nand to love justice.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",

All\nthese things happen to them by reason of their ignorance of what is\ngood and evil. ... I can neither be injured by any of them, for no one\ncan fix on me what is ugly, nor can I be angry with my kinsman, nor\nhate him.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "A limit of time is fixed for you, which if you do not use for clearing\naway the clouds from your mind, it will go and you will go, and it will\nnever return.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "You will give yourself relief, if you do every act of your life as if\nit were the last.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Failure to observe what is in the mind of another has seldom made a man\nunhappy; but those who do not observe the movements of their own minds\nmust of necessity be unhappy.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",

    "Death and life, honor and dishonor, pain and pleasure \u2014 all these\nthings equally happen to good men and bad, being things which make us\nneither better nor worse. Therefore they are neither good nor evil.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "How quickly things disappear: in the universe the bodies themselves,\nbut in time the memory of them.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",

    "Even the smallest thing should be done with reference to an end.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "What then can guide a man? One thing and only one, philosophy. But this\nconsists in keeping the daimon within a man free from violence and\nunharmed, superior to pains and pleasures, doing nothing without a\npurpose, nor yet falsely and with hypocrisy.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Finally, waiting for death with a cheerful mind, as being nothing else\nthan a dissolution of the elements of which every living being is\ncompounded. But if there is no harm to the elements themselves in each\ncontinually changing into another, why should a man have any\napprehension about the change and dissolution of all the elements?\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Hippocrates, after curing many diseases, himself fell sick and died.\n... Alexander and Pompeius and Gaius Caesar, after so often completely\ndestroying whole cities ... themselves, too, at last departed from\nlife. ... And lice destroyed Democritus; and other lice killed\nSocrates.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other\npeople, but care more about their opinion than our own.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "What does all this mean? You have embarked, made the voyage, and come\nto the shore; get out. If indeed to another life, there is no want of\ngods, not even there. But if to a state without sensation, you will\ncease to be held by pains and pleasures, and to be a slave to the\nvessel.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Do not waste the remainder of your life in thoughts about others ...\nfor you lose the opportunity of doing something else when you have such\nthoughts as these.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",

    "Labor willingly and diligently, undistracted and aware of the common\ninterest. ... Be cheerful also, and do not seek external help or the\ntranquillity that others give. A man then must stand erect, not be kept\nerect by others.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",

    "Brief is man's life and small the nook of the earth where he lives;\nbrief, too, is the longest posthumous fame, buoyed only by a succession\nof poor human beings who will very soon die and who know little of\nthemselves, much less of someone who died long ago.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",

    "Perhaps the desire of the thing called fame torments you. See how soon\neverything is forgotten, and look at the chaos of infinite time on each\nside of the present, and the emptiness of applause, and the fickleness\nand lack of judgment in those who pretend to give praise, and the\nnarrowness of its domain, and be quiet at last.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Things do not touch the soul, for they are external and remain\nimmovable; so our perturbations come only from our inner opinions.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "The universe is transformation: life is opinion.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "If the intellectual is common to all men, so is reason, in respect of\nwhich we are rational beings: if this is so, common also is the reason\nthat commands us what to do, and what not to do; if this is so, there\nis a common law also; if this is so, we are fellow-citizens; if this is\nso, we are members of some political community.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Take away your opinion, and then there is taken away the complaint, \"I\nhave been harmed.\" Take away the complaint, \"I have been harmed,\" and\nthe harm is taken away.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",

    "Do you have reason? I have. Why then do you not use it?\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",

    "Do what is necessary, and whatever the reason of a social animal\nnaturally requires, and as it requires.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Since the greatest part of what we say and do is unnecessary,\ndispensing with such activities affords a man more leisure and less\nuneasiness.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Your life is short. You must turn to profit the present by the aid of\nreason and justice.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "In like manner view also the other epochs of time and of whole nations,\nand see how many after great efforts soon fell and were resolved into\nthe elements.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",

    "Be like the promontory against which the waves continually break; but\nit stands firm and tames the fury of the water around it.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "\"I am unhappy, because this has happened to me.\" Not so: say, \"I am\nhappy, though this has happened to me, because I continue free from\npain, neither crushed by the present nor fearing the future.\"\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Remember, too, on every occasion that leads you to vexation to apply\nthis principle: not that this is a misfortune, but that to bear it\nnobly is good fortune.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Altogether the interval is small between birth and death; and consider\nwith how much trouble, and in company with what sort of people and in\nwhat a feeble body, this interval is laboriously passed.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",

    "A man when he has done a good act, does not call out for others to come\nand see, but he goes on to another act, as a vine goes on to produce\nagain the grapes in season.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Do not be disgusted, discouraged, or dissatisfied if you do not succeed\nin doing everything according to right principles; but when you have\nfailed, return again, and be content if the greater part of what you do\nis consistent with man's nature.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "To rest in these principles only: the one, that nothing will happen to\nme which is not conformable to the nature of the universe; and the\nother, that it is in my power never to act contrary to my god and\ndaimon: for there is no man who will compel me to this.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Every part of me then will be reduced by change into some part of the\nuniverse, and that again will change into another part of the universe,\nand so on forever.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Such as are your habitual thoughts, such also will be the character of\nyour mind; for the soul is dyed by the thoughts. Dye it then with a\ncontinuous series of such thoughts as these: for instance, that where a\nman can live, there he can also live well.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Where the end is, there also is the advantage and the good of each\nthing. Now the good for the reasonable animal is society.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Think of the universal substance, of which you have a very small\nportion; and of universal time, of which a short and indivisible\ninterval has been assigned to you; and of that which is fixed by\ndestiny, and how small a part of it you are.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "As you intend to live when you are gone, so it is in your power to live\nhere. But if men do not permit you, then get away out of life, as if\nyou were suffering no harm. The house is smoky, and I quit it. Why do\nyou think that this is any trouble? But so long as nothing of the kind\ndrives me out, I remain, am free, and no man shall hinder me from doing\nwhat I choose; and I choose to do what is according to the nature of\nthe rational and social animal.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "The history of your life is now complete and your service is ended: and\nhow many beautiful things you have seen; and how many pleasures and\npains you have despised; and how many things called honorable you have\nspurned; and to how many ill-minded folks you have shown a kind\ndisposition.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "You can pass your life in an equable flow of happiness if you can\nfollow the right way and think and act in the right way.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Let it make no difference to you whether you are cold or warm, if you\nare doing your duty; and whether you are drowsy or satisfied with\nsleep; and whether ill- spoken of or praised; and whether dying or\ndoing something else.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "When you have been compelled by circumstances to be disturbed in a\nmanner, quickly return to yourself and do not continue out of tune\nlonger than the compulsion lasts.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Suppose then that you have given up this worthless thing called fame,\nwhat remains that is worth valuing? This, in my opinion: to move\nyourself and to restrain yourself in conformity to your proper\nconstitution, to which end all employments and arts lead.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "How strangely men act. They will not praise those who are living at the\nsame time and living with themselves; but to be themselves praised by\nposterity, by those whom they have never seen or ever will see, this\nthey set much value on.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Let us overlook many things in those who are like antagonists in the\ngymnasium. For it is in our power, as I said, to get out of the way and\nto have no suspicion or hatred.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "If any man is able to convince me and show me that I do not think or\nact right, I will gladly change; for I seek the truth by which no man\nwas ever injured. But he is injured who abides in his error and\nignorance.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Alexander the Macedonian and his groom were brought to the same state\nby death; for either they were received among the same seminal\nprinciples of the universe, or they were alike dispersed among the\natoms.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "They are certainly moved toward things because they suppose them to be\nsuitable to their nature and profitable to them. \"But it is not so.\"\nTeach them then, and show them without being angry.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Return to your sober senses and call yourself back; and when you have\nroused yourself from sleep and have perceived that they were only\ndreams that troubled you, now in your waking hours look at these (the\nthings about you) as you did look at those (the dreams).\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "My city and country, so far as I am Antoninus, is Rome; but so far as I\nam a man, it is the world.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "You will observe this general truth, that whatever is profitable to any\nman is profitable also to other men.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Think continually that all kinds of men, pursuits, and nations are\ndead.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "One thing here is worth a great deal: to pass your life in truth and\njustice, with a benevolent disposition even to liars and unjust men.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "When you wish to delight yourself, think of the virtues of those who\nlive with you; for instance, the activity of one, the modesty of\nanother, the liberality of a third, and some other good quality of a\nfourth.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "He who loves fame considers another man's activity to be his own good;\nand he who loves pleasure, his own sensations; but he who has\nunderstanding considers his own acts to be his own good.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "It is in our power to have no opinion about a thing and not to be\ndisturbed in our soul; for things themselves have no natural power to\nform our judgments.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Accustom yourself to attend carefully to what is said by another, and\nas much as it is possible, try to inhabit the speaker's mind.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "How soon will time cover all things, and how many it has covered\nalready.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "In whatever I do, either by myself or with another, I must direct my\nenergies to this alone, that it shall conduce to the common interest\nand be in harmony with it.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "He who lives in harmony with himself lives in harmony with the world.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "To the rational animal the same act is at once according to nature and\naccording to reason.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Whatever any one does or says, I must be good, just as if the emerald\n(or the gold or the purple) were always saying \"Whatever any one does\nor says, I must be emerald and keep my color.\"\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Is any man afraid of change? What can take place without change? What\nthen is more pleasing or more suitable to the universal nature? And can\nyou take a hot bath unless the wood for the fire undergoes a change?\nAnd can you be nourished unless the food undergoes a change? And can\nanything else that is useful be accomplished without change? Do you not\nsee then that for yourself also to change is just the same, and equally\nnecessary for the universal nature?\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "In a little while you will have forgotten everything; in a little while\neverything will have forgotten you.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "It is peculiar to man to love even those who do wrong. And this\nhappens, if when they do wrong it occurs to you that they are fellow\nhumans and that they do wrong through ignorance and unintentionally,\nand that soon both of you will die; and above all, that the wrongdoer\nhas done you no harm, for he has not made your ruling faculty worse\nthan it was before.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "If even the perception of doing wrong departs, what reason is there for\nliving any longer?\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "When a man has done you wrong, immediately consider with what opinion\nabout good or evil he has done wrong. For when you have seen this, you\nwill pity him, and will neither wonder nor be angry.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Think not so much of what you lack as of what you have: but of the\nthings that you have, select the best, and then reflect how eagerly you\nwould have sought them if you did not have them. At the same time,\nhowever, take care that you do not through being so pleased with them\naccustom yourself to overvalue them, so as to be disturbed if you\nshould ever not have them.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "About death: Whether it is a dispersion, or a resolution into atoms, or\nannihilation, it is either extinction or change.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "The mind maintains its own tranquillity by retiring into itself, and\nthe ruling faculty is not made worse. But the parts that are harmed by\npain, let them, if they can, give their opinion about it.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Consider that as the heaps of sand piled on one another hide the former\nsands, so in life the events that go before are soon covered by those\nthat come after.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "No man can escape his destiny, the next inquiry being how he may best\nlive the time that he has to live.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "To have contemplated human life for forty years is the same as to have\ncontemplated it for ten thousand years. For what more will you see?\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Only attend to yourself, and resolve to be a good man in every act that\nyou do.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "The art of life is more like the wrestler's art than the dancer's, in\nrespect of this, that it should stand ready and firm to meet onsets\nthat are sudden and unexpected.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Constantly observe who those are whose approbation you wish to have,\nand what ruling principles they possess. For then you will neither\nblame those who offend involuntarily, nor will you want their\napprobation if you look to the sources of their opinions and appetites.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",

    "Very little indeed is necessary for living a happy life.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "The judgment should be able to say to the thing that falls under its\nobservation: This you are in substance (reality), though in men's\nopinion you may appear to be of a different kind.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "The perfection of moral character consists in this, in passing every\nday as if it were the last, and in being neither violently excited nor\ntorpid nor playing the hypocrite.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "It is a ridiculous thing for a man not to fly from his own badness,\nwhich is indeed possible, but to fly from other men's badness, which is\nimpossible.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "When you have done a good act and another has received it, why do you\nlook for a third thing besides these, as fools do, either to have the\nreputation of having done a good act or to obtain a return?\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "On the occasion of every act ask yourself, How is this with respect to\nme? Will I regret it? A little time and I am dead, and all is gone.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Consider that men will do the same things even though you would burst\nwith rage.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",

    "You have not leisure or ability to read. But you have leisure or\nability to check arrogance: you have leisure to be superior to pleasure\nand pain: you have leisure to be superior to love of fame, and not to\nbe vexed at stupid and ungrateful people, nay even to care for them.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Constantly and, if it be possible, on the occasion of every impression\non the soul, apply to it the principles of physics, ethics, and\ndialectics [logic].\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Whatever man you meet with, immediately say to yourself: What opinions\nhas this man about good and bad?\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "If a thing is in your own power, why do you do it? But if it is in the\npower of another, whom do you blame? The atoms (chance) or the gods?\nBoth are foolish. You must blame nobody.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Nothing should be done without a purpose.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "It is a proper work of a man to be benevolent to his own kind, to\ndespise the movements of the senses, to form a just judgment of\nplausible appearances, and to take a survey of the nature of the\nuniverse and of the things that happen in it.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Now it is in my power to let no badness be in this soul, nor desire nor\nany perturbation at all; but looking at all things, I see their true\nnature, and I use each according to its value.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Receive wealth or prosperity without arrogance; and be ready to let it\ngo.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Do not let your thoughts at once embrace all the various troubles that\nyou may expect to befall you: but on every occasion ask yourself, What\nis there in this that is intolerable and past bearing? For you will be\nashamed to confess.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "I see no virtue that is opposed to justice; but I see a virtue that is\nopposed to love of pleasure, and that is temperance.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Different things delight different people. But it is my delight to keep\nthe ruling faculty sound without turning away either from any man or\nfrom any of the things that happen to men, but looking at and receiving\nall with welcoming eyes and using everything according to its value.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Those who rather pursue posthumous fame do not consider that the men of\ntomorrow will be exactly like these whom they cannot bear now; and both\nare mortal.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Take me and cast me where you will; for there I shall keep my divine\npart tranquil, that is, content, if it can feel and act conformably to\nits proper constitution.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "If you are pained by any external thing, it is not this thing that\ndisturbs you, but your own judgment about it. And it is in your power\nto wipe out this judgment now.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",

    "He who fears death fears either the loss of sensation or a different\nkind of sensation. But if you shall have no sensation, neither will you\nfeel any harm; and if you will acquire another kind of sensation, you\nwill be a different kind of living being and you will not cease to\nlive.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Men exist for the sake of one another. Teach them then or bear with\nthem.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Injustice is impiety. For since the universal nature has made rational\nanimals for the sake of one another to help one another according to\ntheir deserts, but in no way to injure one another, he who transgresses\nher will is clearly guilty of impiety toward the highest divinity.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "He who is afraid of pain will sometimes also be afraid of some of the\nthings that will happen in the world, and even this is impiety. And he\nwho pursues pleasure will not abstain from injustice, and this is\nplainly impiety.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "This, then, is consistent with the character of a reflecting man, to be\nneither careless nor impatient nor contemptuous with respect to death,\nbut to wait for it as one of the operations of nature.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "He who does wrong does wrong against himself. He who acts unjustly acts\nunjustly to himself, because he makes himself bad.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "He often acts unjustly who does not do a certain thing; not only he who\ndoes a certain thing.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "If you are able, correct by teaching those who do wrong; but if you\ncannot, remember that indulgence is given to you for this purpose.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Labor not as one who is wretched, nor yet as one who would be pitied or\nadmired; but direct your will to one thing only: to act or not to act\nas social reason requires.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Today I have got out of all trouble, or rather I have cast out all\ntrouble, for it was not outside, but within and in my opinions.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Things stand outside of us, themselves by themselves, neither knowing\nanything of themselves nor expressing any judgment. What is it, then,\nthat passes judgment on them? The ruling faculty.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "All things are changing: and you yourself are in continuous mutation\nand in a manner in continuous destruction, and the whole universe, too.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "As you yourself are a component part of a social system, so let every\nact of yours be a component part of social life.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "When another blames you or hates you, or when men say anything\ninjurious about you, approach their poor souls, penetrate within, and\nsee what kind of men they are. You will discover that there is no\nreason to be concerned that these men have this or that opinion about\nyou.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "In a word, if there is a god, all is well; and if chance rules, do not\nalso be governed by it.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Set yourself in motion, if it is in your power, and do not look about\nyou to see if anyone will observe it; nor yet expect Plato's Republic:\nbut be content if the smallest thing goes on well, and consider such an\nevent to be no small matter.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "The work of philosophy is simple and modest. Do not draw me aside into\npomposity.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "How short is the time from birth to dissolution, and the illimitable\ntime before birth as well as the equally boundless time after\ndissolution.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Either all things proceed from one intelligent source and come together\nas in one body, and the part ought not to find fault with what is done\nfor the benefit of the whole; or there are only atoms, and nothing else\nthan mixture and dispersion.  Why, then, are you disturbed?\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "When you are offended with any man's shameless conduct, immediately ask\nyourself, is it possible, then, that shameless men should not be in the\nworld? It is not possible. Do not, then, require what is impossible.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Where is the harm or the strangeness in the boor acting like a boor?\nSee whether you are not yourself the more to blame in not expecting\nthat he would err in such a way. For you had means given you by your\nreason to suppose that it was likely that he would commit this error,\nand yet you have forgotten and are amazed that he has erred.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "The rational animal is consequently also a social animal.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "If a man is mistaken, instruct him kindly and show him his error. But\nif you are not able, blame yourself, or not even yourself.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Whether the universe is a concourse of atoms, or nature is a system,\nlet this first be established: that I am a part of the whole that is\ngoverned by nature; next, that I stand in some intimate connection with\nother kindred parts.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "When you have assumed these names\u2014good, modest, truthful, rational, a\nman of equanimity, and magnanimous\u2014take care that you do not change\nthese names; and if you should lose them, quickly return to them.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Acquire the contemplative way of seeing how all things change into one\nanother, and constantly attend to it, and exercise yourself about this\npart of philosophy. For nothing is so much adapted to produce\nmagnanimity.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "He who follows reason in all things is both tranquil and active at the\nsame time, and also cheerful and collected.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "No longer talk at all about the kind of man that a good man ought to\nbe, but be such.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Consider what men are when they are eating, sleeping, coupling,\nevacuating, and so forth. Then what kind of men they are when they are\nimperious and arrogant, or angry and scolding from their elevated\nplace.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "When you are offended at any man's fault, immediately turn to yourself\nand reflect in what manner you yourself have erred: for example, in\nthinking that money is a good thing or pleasure, or a bit of\nreputation, and the like.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "A brief existence is common to all things, and yet you avoid and pursue\nall things as if they would be eternal.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",

    "What is your art? To be good. And how is this accomplished well except\nby general principles, some about the nature of the universe, and\nothers about the proper constitution of man?\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Justice will not be observed, if we either care for indifferent things\nor are easily deceived and careless and changeable.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Shall any man hate me? That will be his affair. But I will be mild and\nbenevolent toward every man, and ready to show even him his mistake,\nnot reproachfully, nor yet as making a display of my endurance, but\nnobly and honestly.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Consider that you also do many things wrong, and that you are a man\nlike others; and even if you do abstain from certain faults, still you\nhave the disposition to commit them, though either through cowardice,\nor concern about reputation, or some such mean motive, you abstain from\nsuch faults.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "A man must learn a great deal to enable him to pass a correct judgment\non another man's acts.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "It is our own opinions that disturb us. Take away these opinions then,\nand resolve to dismiss your judgment about an act as if it were\nsomething grievous, and your anger is gone.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "To expect bad men not to do wrong is madness, for he who expects this\ndesires an impossibility. But to allow men to behave so to others, and\nto expect them not to do you any wrong, is irrational and tyrannical.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "In the writings of the Ephesians there was this precept: constantly to\nthink of one of the men of former times who practiced virtue.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "The Pythagoreans bid us in the morning look to the heavens that we may\nbe reminded of those bodies that continually do the same things and in\nthe same manner perform their work, and also be reminded of their\npurity and nudity. For there is no veil over a star.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "If you shall be afraid not because you must some time cease to live,\nbut if you shall fear never to have begun to live according to\nnature\u2014then you will be a man worthy of the universe that has produced\nyou, and you will cease to be a stranger in your native land.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "You are composed of three things: body, breath (life), intelligence. Of\nthese the first two are yours insofar as it is your duty to take care\nof them; but the third alone is truly yours.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "I have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself more than\nall the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own opinion of\nhimself than on the opinion of others.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "In the application of your principles you must be like the pancratiast,\nnot like the gladiator. For the latter lays aside the blade he uses,\nand takes it up again, but the former always has his hand and needs\nonly to clench it.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Either there is a fatal necessity and invincible order, or a kind\nProvidence, or a confusion without a purpose and without a director. If\nthen there is an invincible necessity, why do you resist? But if there\nis a Providence that allows itself to be propitiated, make yourself\nworthy of the help of the divinity. But if there is a confusion without\na governor, be content that in such a tempest you have yourself a\ncertain ruling intelligence.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "If it is not right, do not do it: if it is not true, do not say it. For\nlet your impulse be in your own power.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "First, do nothing inconsiderately or without a purpose. Second, make\nyour acts refer to nothing else but a social end.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Consider that before long you will be nobody and nowhere, nor will any\nof the things exist that you now see, nor any of those who are now\nliving. For all things are formed by nature to change and be turned and\nto perish in order that other things in continuous succession may\nexist.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Consider that everything is opinion, and opinion is in your power. Take\naway then, when you choose, your opinion, and like a mariner who has\nrounded the headland, you will find calm, everything stable, and a\nwaveless bay.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "With respect to what may happen to you from without, consider that it\nhappens either by chance or according to Providence, and you must\nneither blame chance nor accuse Providence.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "Constantly recall those who have complained greatly about anything,\nthose who have been most conspicuous by the greatest fame or\nmisfortunes or enmities or fortunes of any kind: then think, Where are\nthey all now? Smoke and ash and a tale, or not even a tale.\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "How small a part of the boundless and unfathomable time is assigned to\nevery man! For it is very soon swallowed up in the eternal. And how\nsmall a part of the whole substance! And how small a part of the\nuniversal soul! And on what a small clod of the whole earth you creep!\n\t--Marcus Aurelius",
    "There's no difference between the one and the other - you didn't exist\nand you won't exist - you've got no concern with either period. As it\nis with a play, so it is with life - what matters is not how long the\nacting lasts, but how good it is. It is not important at what point you\nstop. Stop wherever you will - only make sure that you round it off\nwith a good ending.\n\t--Seneca",
    "There are times when even to live is an act of bravery. So there is the\ncomforting thing about extremities of pain: if you feel it too much you\nare bound to stop feeling it. The love of power or money or luxurious\nliving are not the only things which are guided by popular thinking. We\ntake our cue from people's thinking even in the way we feel pain.\nAnother thing which will help you is to turn your mind to other\nthoughts and that way get away from your suffering. Call to mind things\nwhich you have done that have been upright or courageous; run over in\nyour mind the finest parts you have played. \"But my illness has taken\nme away from my duties and won't allow me to achieve anything.\" It is\nyour body, not your mind as well, that is in the grip of ill health.\n\t--Seneca",
    "Drunkenness inflames and lays bare every vice, removing the reserve\nthat acts as a chuck on impulses to wrong behaviour.\n\t--Seneca",
    "...pleasures, when they go beyond a certain limit, are but punishments\u2026\n\t--Seneca",
    "So I look for the best and am prepared for the opposite.\n\t--Seneca",
    "There is nothing dangerous in a man's having as much power as he likes\nif he takes the view that he has power to do only what it is his duty\nto do.\n\t--Seneca",
    "The things that are essential are acquired with little bother; it is\nthe luxuries that call for toil and effort.\n\t--Seneca",
    "One thing I know: all the works of mortal man lie under sentence of\nmortality; we live among things that are destined to perish.\n\t--Seneca",
    "A setback has often cleared the way for greater prosperity. Many things\nhave fallen only to rise to more exalted heights.\n\t--Seneca",
    "When it comes to all we're required to go through, we're equals. No one\nis more vulnerable than the next man, and no one can be more sure of\nhis surviving to the morrow.\n\t--Seneca",
    "And no one has power over us when death is within our own power.\n\t--Seneca",
    "The man who spends his time choosing one resort after another in a hunt\nfor peace and quiet, will in every place he visits find something to\nprevent him from relaxing.\n\t--Seneca",
    "Now think of the things which goad man into destroying man: they are\nhope, envy, hatred, fear and contempt.\n\t--Seneca",
    "...to be feared is to fear: no one has been able to strike terror into\nothers and at the same time enjoy peace of mind himself.\n\t--Seneca",
    "People who know no self-restraint lead stormy and disordered lives,\npassing their time in a state of fear commensurate with the injuries\nthey do to others, never able to relax. After every act they tremble,\nparalysed, their consciences continually demanding an answer, not\nallowing them to get on with other things. To expect punishment is to\nsuffer it; and to earn it is to expect it.\n\t--Seneca",
    "Others have been plundered, indiscriminately, set upon, betrayed,\nbeaten up, attacked with poison or with calumny - mention anything you\nlike, it has happened to plenty of people.\n\t--Seneca",
