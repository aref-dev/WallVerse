Let\nus then continue our voyage-each for the other's sake, for a long time\nyet, a long time! We should miss each other so much!

    "One must learn to love.- This is what happens to us in music: first one\nhas to learn to hear a figure and melody at all, to detect and\ndistinguish it, to isolate it and delimit it as a separate life; then\nit requires some exertion and good will to tolerate it in spite of its\nstrangeness, to be patient with its appearance and expression, and\nkindhearted about its oddity:-finally there comes a moment when we are\nused to it, when we wait for it, when we sense that we should miss it\nif it were missing: and now it continues to compel and enchant us\nrelentlessly until we have become its humble and enraptured lovers who\ndesire nothing better from the world than it and only it.- But that is\nwhat happens to us not only in music: that is how we have learned to\nlove all things that we now love. In the end we are always rewarded for\nour good will, our patience, fairmindedness, and gentleness with what\nis strange; gradually, it sheds its veil and turns out to be a new and\nindescribable beauty:-that is its thanks for our hospitality. Even\nthose who love themselves will have learned it in this way: for there\nis no other way. Love, too, has to be learned",
    "One must shed the bad taste of wanting to agree with many. \"Good\" is no\nlonger good when one's neighbor mouths it. And how should there be a\n\"common good\"!

    "That which does not  kill me, makes me stronger",
    "I am too inquisitive, too skeptical, too arrogant, to let myself be\nsatisfied with an obvious and crass solution of things.

    "It is the business of the very few to be independent; it is a privilege\nof the strong. And whoever attempts it, even with the best right, but\nwithout being OBLIGED to do so, proves that he is probably not only\nstrong, but also daring beyond measure. He enters into a labyrinth, he\nmultiplies a thousandfold the dangers which life in itself already\nbrings with it; not the least of which is that no one can see how and\nwhere he loses his way, becomes isolated, and is torn piecemeal by some\nminotaur of conscience. Supposing such a one comes to grief, it is so\nfar from the comprehension of men that they neither feel it, nor\nsympathize with it. And he cannot any longer go back! He cannot even go\nback again to the sympathy of men!",
    "Of all that is written, I love only what a person hath written with his\nblood. Write with blood, and thou wilt find that blood is spirit. It is\nno easy task to understand unfamiliar blood; I hate the reading idlers.\nHe who knoweth the reader, doeth nothing more for the reader. Another\ncentury of readers--and spirit itself will stink. Every one being\nallowed to learn to read, ruineth in the long run not only writing but\nalso thinking. Once spirit was God, then it became man, and now it even\nbecometh populace. He that writeth in blood and proverbs doth not want\nto be read, but learnt by heart. In the mountains the shortest way is\nfrom peak to peak, but for that route thou must have long legs.\nProverbs should be peaks, and those spoken to should be big and tall.\nThe atmosphere rare and pure, danger near and the spirit full of a\njoyful wickedness: thus are things well matched. I want to have goblins\nabout me, for I am courageous. The courage which scareth away ghosts,\ncreateth for itself goblins--it wanteth to laugh",

    "He who has attained the freedom of reason to any extent cannot, for a\nlong time, regard himself otherwise than as a wanderer on the face of\nthe earth - and not even as a traveler towards a final goal, for there\nis no such thing. But he certainly wants to observe and keep his eyes\nopen to whatever actually happens in the world; therefore he cannot\nattach his heart too firmly to anything individual; he must have in\nhimself something wandering that takes pleasure in change and\ntransitoriness",
    "If we train our conscience, it kisses us while it hurts",
    "The most spiritual men, as the strongest, find their happiness where\nothers would find their destruction: in the labyrinth, in hardness\nagainst themselves and others, in experiments. Their joy is self-\nconquest: asceticism becomes in them nature, need, and instinct.\nDifficult tasks are a privilege to them; to play with burdens that\ncrush others, a recreation. Knowledge-a form of asceticism. They are\nthe most venerable kind of man: that does not preclude their being the\nmost cheerful and the kindliest",

    "Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the Superman--a rope\nover an abyss.   A dangerous crossing, a dangerous wayfaring, a\ndangerous looking-back, a dangerous trembling and halting.   What is\ngreat in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal:  what is lovable in\nman is that he is an OVER-GOING and a DOWN-GOING.   I love those that\nknow not how to live except as down-goers, for they are the over-goers.\nI love the great despisers, because they are the great adorers, and\narrows of longing for the other shore.   I love those who do not first\nseek a reason beyond the stars for going down and being sacrifices, but\nsacrifice themselves to the earth, that the earth of the Superman may\nhereafter arrive.   I love him who lives in order to know, and seeks to\nknow in order that the Superman may hereafter live.  Thus seeks he his\nown down-going.   I love him who labors and invents, that he may build\nthe house for the Superman, and prepare for him earth, animal, and\nplant:  for thus seeks he his own down-going.   I love him who loves\nhis virtue:  for virtue is the will to down-going, and an arrow of\nlonging.   I love him who reserves no share of spirit for himself, but\nwants to be wholly the spirit of his virtue:  thus walks he as spirit\nover the bridge.   I love him who makes his virtue his inclination and\ndestiny:  thus, for the sake of his virtue, he is willing to live on,\nor live no more.   I love him who desires not too many virtues.  One\nvirtue is more of a virtue than two, because it is more of a knot for\none's destiny to cling to.   I love him whose soul is lavish, who wants\nno thanks and does not give back:  for he always bestows, and desires\nnot to keep for himself.   I love him who is ashamed when the dice fall\nin his favor, and who then asks:  \"Am I a dishonest player?\"--for he is\nwilling to succumb.   I love him who scatters golden words in advance\nof his deeds, and always does more than he promises:  for he seeks his\nown down-going.   I love him who justifies the future ones, and redeems\nthe past ones: for he is willing to succumb through the present ones.\nI love him who chastens his God, because he loves his God:  for he must\nsuccumb through the wrath of his God.   I love him whose soul is deep\neven in the wounding, and may succumb through a small matter:  thus\ngoes he willingly over the bridge.   I love him whose soul is so\noverfull that he forgets himself, and all things that are in him:  thus\nall things become his down-going.   I love him who is of a free spirit\nand a free heart:  thus is his head only the bowels of his heart; his\nheart, however, causes his down-going.   I love all who are like heavy\ndrops falling one by one out of the dark cloud that lowers over man:\nthey herald the coming of the lightning, and succumb as heralds.   Lo,\nI am a herald of the lightning, and a heavy drop out of the cloud:  the\nlightning, however, is the SUPERMAN.--",

    "You know these things as thoughts, but your thoughts are not your\nexperiences, they are an echo and after-effect of your experiences: as\nwhen your room trembles whe na carriage goes past. I however am sitting\nin the carriage, and often I am the carriage itself. Ina man who thinks\nlike this, the dichotomy between thinking and feeling, intellect and\npassion, has really disappeared. He feels his thoughts. He can fall in\nlove with an idea. An idea can make him ill",

    "Love, too, has to be learned",
    "To learn to see- to accustom the eye to calmness, to patience, and to\nallow things to come up to it; to defer judgment, and to acquire the\nhabit of approaching and grasping an individual case from all sides.\nThis is the first preparatory schooling of intellectuality. One must\nnot respond immediately to a stimulus; one must acquire a command of\nthe obstructing and isolating instincts",

    "When you stare into the abyss the abyss stares back at you",
    "The slow arrow of beauty. The most noble kind of beauty is that which\ndoes not carry us away suddenly, whose attacks are not violent or\nintoxicating (this kind easily awakens disgust), but rather the kind of\nbeauty which infiltrates slowly, which we carry along with us almost\nunnoticed, and meet up with again in dreams; finally, after it has for\na long time lain modestly in our heart, it takes complete possession of\nus, filling our eyes with tears, our hearts with longing. What do we\nlong for when we see beauty? To be beautiful. We think much happiness\nmust be connected with it. But that is an error",

Imagine to yourselves a being like Nature, boundlessly\nextravagant, boundlessly indifferent, without purpose or consideration,\nwithout pity or justice, at once fruitful and barren and uncertain:\nimagine to yourselves INDIFFERENCE as a power-how COULD you live in\naccordance with such indifference? To live-is not that just\nendeavouring to be otherwise than this Nature? Is not living valuing,\npreferring, being unjust, being limited, endeavouring to be different?\nAnd granted that your imperative, \"living according to Nature,\" means\nactually the same as \"living according to life\"-how could you do\nDIFFERENTLY? Why should you make a principle out of what you yourselves\nare, and must be? In reality, however, it is quite otherwise with you:\nwhile you pretend to read with rapture the canon of your law in Nature,\nyou want something quite the contrary, you extraordinary stage-players\nand self-deluders! In your pride you wish to dictate your morals and\nideals to Nature, to Nature herself, and to incorporate them therein;\nyou insist that it shall be Nature \"according to the Stoa,\" and would\nlike everything to be made after your own image, as a vast, eternal\nglorification and generalism of Stoicism! With all your love for truth,\nyou have forced yourselves so long, so persistently, and with such\nhypnotic rigidity to see Nature FALSELY, that is to say, Stoically,\nthat you are no longer able to see it otherwise-and to crown all, some\nunfathomable superciliousness gives you the Bedlamite hope that BECAUSE\nyou are able to tyrannize over yourselves-Stoicism is self-tyranny-\nNature will also allow herself to be tyrannized over: is not the Stoic\na PART of Nature?... But this is an old and everlasting story: what\nhappened in old times with the Stoics still happens today, as soon as\never a philosophy begins to believe in itself. It always creates the\nworld in its own image; it cannot do otherwise; philosophy is this\ntyrannical impulse itself, the most spiritual Will to Power, the will\nto \"creation of the world,\" the will to the causa prima",

The \"honor\" of women\nreally comes into play only here: what else would one not forgive them?\nBut here they are supposed to remain ignorant even in their hearts:\nthey are supposed to have neither eyes nor ears, nor words, nor\nthoughts for this -- their \"evil;\" and mere knowledge is considered\nevil. And then to be hurled as by a gruesome lightning bolt, into\nreality and knowledge, by marriage -- precisely by the man they love\nand esteem most! To catch love and shame in a contradiction and to be\nforced to experience at the same time delight, surrender, duty, pity,\nterror, and who knows what else, in the face of the unexpected\nneighborliness of god and beast! Thus a psychic knot has been tied that\nmay have no equal. Even the compassionate curiosity of the wisest\nstudent of humanity is inadequate for guessing how this or that woman\nmanages to accommodate herself to this solution of the riddle, and to\nthe riddle of a solution, and what dreadful, far-reaching suspicions\nmust stir in her poor, unhinged soul -- and how the ultimate philosophy\nand skepsis of woman casts anchor at this point! Afterward, the same\ndeep silence as before. Often a silence directed at herself, too. She\ncloses her eyes to herself. Young women try hard to appear superficial\nand thoughtless. The most refined simulate a kind of impertinence.\nWomen easily experience their husbands as a question mark concerning\ntheir honor, and their children as an apology or atonement.

To the extent that man has for\nlong ages believed in the concepts and names of things as in aeternae\nveritates he has appropriated to himself that pride by which he raised\nhimself above the animal: he really thought that in language he\npossessed knowledge of the world.  The sculptor of language was not so\nmodest as to believe that he was only giving things designations, he\nconceived rather that with words he was expressing supreame knowledge\nof things; language is, in fact, the first stage of occupation with\nscience.  Here, too, it is the belief that the truth has been found out\nof which the mightiest sources of energy have flowed.  A great deal\nlater - only now - it dawns on men that in their belief in language\nthey have propagated a tremendous error.

In other words, the less one knows how to\ncommand, the more urgently one covets someone who commands, who\ncommands severely-a god, prince, class, physician, father confessor,\ndogma, or party conscience. From this one might perhaps gather that the\ntwo world religions, Buddhism and Christianity, may have owed their\norigin and above all their sudden spread to a tremendous collapse and\ndisease of the will. And that is what actually happened: both religions\nencountered a situation in which the will had become diseased, giving\nrise to a demand that had become utterly desperate for some \"thou\nshalt.\" Both religions taught fanaticism in ages in which the will had\nbecome exhausted, and thus they offered innumerable people some\nsupport, a new possibility of willing, some delight in willing. For\nfanaticism is the only \"strength of the will\" that even the weak and\ninsecure can be brought to attain, being a sort of hypnotism of the\nwhole system of the senses and the intellect for the benefit of an\nexcessive nourishment (hypertrophy) of a single point of view and\nfeeling that henceforth becomes dominant- which the Christian calls his\nfaith. Once a human being reaches the fundamental conviction that he\nmust be commanded, he becomes \"a believer.\"  Conversely, one could\nconceive of such a pleasure and power of self-determination, such a\nfreedom of the will [ This conception of \"freedom of the will\" ( alias,\nautonomy) does not involve any belief in what Nietzsche called \"the\nsuperstition of free will\" in section 345 ( alias, the exemption of\nhuman actions from an otherwise universal determinism).] that the\nspirit would take leave of all faith and every wish for certainty,\nbeing practiced in maintaining himself on insubstantial ropes and\npossibilities and dancing even near abysses.

In contrast to this, picture 'the enemy' as the man of\nressentiment conceives him-and here precisely is his deed, his\ncreation: he has conceived 'the evil enemy,' 'the Evil One,' and this\nin fact is his basic concept, from which he then evolves, as an\nafterthought and pendant, a 'good one'-himself!",

In my view, Dante was grossly in error when, with an\ningenuity inspiring terror, he set that inscription over the gateway\ninto his hell:\"Eternal love also created me.\" Over the gateway into the\nChristian paradise and its \"eternal blessedness\" it would, in  any\nevent, be more fitting to let the inscription stand \"Eternal hate also\ncreated me\"-provided its all right to set a truth over the gateway to a\nlie! For what is the bliss of that paradise? Perhaps we might have\nguessed that already, but it is better for it to be expressly described\nfor us by an authority we cannot underestimate in such matters, Thomas\nAquinas, the great teacher and saint: \"In the kingdom of heaven\" he\nsays as gently as a lamb, \"the blessed will see the punishment of the\ndamned, so that they will derive all the more pleasure from their\nheavenly bliss",

WHO is it really that puts questions to us here? WHAT really\nis this \"Will to Truth\" in us? In fact we made a long halt at the\nquestion as to the origin of this Will-until at last we came to an\nabsolute standstill before a yet more fundamental question. We inquired\nabout the VALUE of this Will. Granted that we want the truth: WHY NOT\nRATHER untruth? And uncertainty? Even ignorance?

I consider bad conscience the profound illness which human beings\nhad to come down with, under the pressure of the most fundamental of\nall the changes which they experienced-that change when they finally\nfound themselves locked within the confines of society and peace. Just\nlike the things water animals must have gone though when they were\nforced either to become land animals or to die off, so events must have\nplayed themselves out with this half-beast so happily adapted to the\nwilderness, war, wandering around, adventure-suddenly all its instincts\nwere devalued and disengaged.  From this point on, these animals were\nto go on foot and carry themselves; whereas previously they had been\nsupported by the water. A terrible heaviness weighed them down. In\nperforming the simplest things they felt ungainly. In dealing with this\nnew unknown world, they no longer had their old leader, the ruling\nunconscious drives which guided them safely. These unfortunate\ncreatures were reduced to thinking, inferring, calculating, bringing\ntogether cause and effect, reduced to their consciousness, their most\nimpoverished and error-prone organ! I believe that on earth there has\nnever been such a feeling of misery, such a leaden discomfort-while at\nthe same time those old instincts had not all at once stopped imposing\ntheir demands! Only it was difficult and seldom possible to do their\nbidding. For the most part, they had to find new and, as it were,\nunderground satisfactions for them",

To the poet a character is\nnot a whole composed of selected single features, but an insistently\nalive person whom he sees before his very eyes, and distinguished from\na painter's vision of the same thing only by the fact that poet sees\nthe figure continuing to live and act over a period of time. What\nallows Homer to depict things so much more vividly than all other\npoets? It is the fact that he looks at things so much more than they\ndo. We talk so abstractly about poetry because we are usually all bad\npoets. Fundamentally the aesthetic phenomenon is simple; one only has\nto have the ability to watch a living play continuously and to live\nconstantly surrounded by crowds of spirits, then one is a poet; if one\nfeels the impulse to transform oneself and to speak out of other bodies\nand souls, then one is a dramatist",

    "Error regarding life necessary to life. - Every belief in the value and\ndignity of life rests on false thinking; it is possible only through\nthe fact that empathy with the universal life and suffering of mankind\nis very feebly developed in the individual. Even those rarer men who\nthink beyond themselves at all have an eye, not for this universal\nlife, but for fenced-off portions of it. If one knows how to keep the\nexceptions principally in view, I mean the greatly gifted and pure of\nsoul, takes their production for the goal of world-evolution and\nrejoices in the effects they in turn produce, one may believe in the\nvalue of life, because the one is overlooking all other men: thinking\nfalsely, that is to say. And likewise if, though one does keep in view\nall mankind, one accords validity only to one species of drives, the\nless egoistical, and justifies them in face of all the others, then\nagain one can hope for something of mankind as a whole and to this\nextent believe in the value of life: thus, in this case too, through\nfalsity of thinking. Whichever of these attitudes one adopts, however,\none is by adopting in an exception among men. The great majority endure\nlife without complaining overmuch; they believe in the value of\nexistence, but they do so precisely because each of them exists for\nhimself alone, refusing to step out of himself as those exceptions do:\neverything outside themselves they notice not at all or at most as a\ndim shadow. Thus for the ordinary, everyday man the value of life rests\nsolely on the fact that regards himself more highly than he does the\nworld. The great lack of imagination from which he suffers means he is\nunable to feel his way into other beings and thus he participates as\nlittle as possible in their fortunes and sufferings. He, on the other\nhand, who really could participate in them would have to despair of the\nvalue of life; if he succeeded in encompassing and feeling within\nhimself the total consciousness of mankind he would collapse with a\ncurse on existence - for mankind has as a whole no goal, and the\nindividual man when he regards its total course cannot derive from it\nany support or comfort, but must be reduced to despair. If in all he\ndoes he has before him the ultimate goallessness of man, his actions\nacquire in his own eyes the character of useless squandering. But to\nfeel thus squandered, not merely as an individual fruits but as\nhumanity as a whole, in the way we behold the individual fruits of\nnature squandered, is a feeling beyond all other feelings. - But who is\ncapable of such a feeling? Certainly only a poet: and poets always know\nhow to console themselves",

    "Populace above, populace below! What are \"poor\" and \"rich\"..",
    "From the beginning, nothing has been more alien, repugnant, and hostile\nto woman than truth -- her great art is the lie, her highest concern is\nmere appearance of beauty",
    "Pitch-black winter nights live in my bones",
    "It goes to reason if you always on the reasons go",
    "Those who commend work. - In the glorification of 'work', in the\nunwearied talk of the 'blessing of work', I see the same covert idea as\nin the praise of useful impersonal actions: that of fear of everything\nindividual. Fundamentally, one now feels at the sight of work - one\nalways means by work that hard industriousness from early till late -\nthat such work is the best policeman, that it keeps everyone in bounds\nand can mightily hinder the development of reason, covetousness, desire\nfor independence. For it uses up an extraordinary amount of nervous\nenergy, which is thus denied to reflection, brooding, dreaming,\nworrying, loving, hating; it sets a small goal always in sight and\nguarantees easy and regular satisfactions. Thus a society in which\nthere is continual hard work will have more security: and security is\nnow worshipped as the supreme divinity. - And now! Horror! Precisely\nthe 'worker' has become dangerous! The place is swarming with\n'dangerous individuals'! And behind them the danger of dangers - the\nindividual!"
