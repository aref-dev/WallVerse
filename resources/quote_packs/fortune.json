Human\nintellectual capacity has not altered for thousands of years so far as\nwe can tell.  If intelligent people invested intense energy in issues\nthat now seem foolish to us, then the failure lies in our understanding\nof their world, not in their distorted perceptions.  Even the standard\nexample of ancient nonsense -- the debate about angels on pinheads --\nmakes sense once you realize that theologians were not discussing\nwhether five or eighteen would fit, but whether a pin could house a\nfinite or an infinite number.\n\t\t-- S.

But Edison's greatest achievement came in 1879, when he\ninvented the electric company.  Edison's design was a brilliant\nadaptation of the simple electrical circuit: the electric company sends\nelectricity through a wire to a customer, then immediately gets the\nelectricity back through another wire, then (this is the brilliant\npart) sends it right back to the customer again.\n\nThis means that an electric company can sell a customer the same batch\nof electricity thousands of times a day and never get caught, since\nvery few customers take the time to examine their electricity closely.\nIn fact the last year any new electricity was generated in the United\nStates was 1937; the electric companies have been merely re-selling it\never since, which is why they have so much free time to apply for rate\nincreases.\n\t\t-- Dave Barry, \"What is Electricity?\"", "But this has taken us far afield from interface, which is not a bad\nplace to be, since I particularly want to move ahead to the kludge.\nWhy do people have so much trouble understanding the kludge?

You never have to figure out what to get for children,\nbecause they will tell you exactly what they want.  They spend months\nand months researching these kinds of things by watching Saturday-\nmorning cartoon-show advertisements.  Make sure you get your children\nexactly what they ask for, even if you disapprove of their choices.  If\nyour child thinks he wants Murderous Bob, the Doll with the Face You\nCan Rip Right Off, you'd better get it.  You may be worried that it\nmight help to encourage your child's antisocial tendencies, but believe\nme, you have not seen antisocial tendencies until you've seen a child\nwho is convinced that he or she did not get the right gift.\n\t\t-- Dave Barry, \"Christmas Shopping: A Survivor's Guide\"", "\t\t\t-- Gifts for Men --\n\nMen are amused by almost any idiot thing -- that is why professional\nice hockey is so popular -- so buying gifts for them is easy.  But you\nshould never buy them clothes.  Men believe they already have all the\nclothes they will ever need, and new ones make them nervous.  For\nexample, your average man has 84 ties, but he wears, at most, only\nthree of them.  He has learned, through humiliating trial and error,\nthat if he wears any of the other 81 ties, his wife will probably laugh\nat him (\"You're not going to wear THAT tie with that suit, are you?\").\nSo he has narrowed it down to three safe ties, and has gone several\nyears without being laughed at.  If you give him a new tie, he will\npretend to like it, but deep inside he will hate you.\n\nIf you want to give a man something practical, consider tires.
